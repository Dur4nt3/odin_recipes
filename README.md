# Recipes Project | The Odin Project | Foundations

### Overview:

This repository will include the webpages for the project "Recipes" under "The Odin Project"

It should be noted that as I progress through "The Odin Project" this repository will *most likely* be updated.

Regardless of whether updating the project is a given assignment within "The Odin Project", if I see fit, I will utilize this project to practice acquired knowledge.

**Skills demonstrated: Basic HTML usage; basic CSS usage**
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This project might have the added benefit of serving *somewhat* nice and easy recipes without being riddled with **ads**. [^a]

[^a]: Under no circumstance does the project owner promise the recipes actually taste good :wink:
